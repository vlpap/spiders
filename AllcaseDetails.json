{"Current Status:": "Update July 2013 \u2013   H D Administrators LLP was registered as a limited liability partnership on 01 December 2006 and traded as a provider of Self Invested Personal Pensions (SIPPs) within a vehicle known as HD SIPP.   On 22 March 2012, the Financial Services Authority - now the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) - took action to remove the permissions granted to HD Administrators LLP to carry on regulated activities, following the arrests of two of the HD SIPP Trustees.   The removal of these permissions left the 400+ members of the HD SIPP with no means to deal with their SIPP (Self Invested Personal Pension) investments.   HD Administrators LLP was then placed into liquidation on 14 June 2012 upon the petition of a group of creditors, and the Official Receiver in the Public Interest Unit in Manchester was appointed as liquidator.   A large number of the investments made through the HD SIPP were unregulated, and are expected to have little or no remaining value.  The status of these investments meant that a straight transfer of the HD SIPP to an alternative provider was not viable, due to the likely attachment of tax charges to that new provider.   Following a long period of cooperation between the Official Receiver, The FCA, and industry professionals, a plan has been formulated with Mattioli Woods Ltd for alternative administration services to be provided to HD SIPP holders.   Contact will shortly be made with each SIPP holder by Mattioli Woods PLC to present options available to them.   All further enquiries in this regard should be made directly to Mattioli Woods PLC on 0116 240 8700.  Further information regarding Mattioli Woods PLC is available at http://www.mattioli-woods.com/index.php"},

The company is believed to have been dormant until at March 2011 when it is understood to have commenced trading in the marketing, promotion and sale of photovoltaic solar panels to the general public.  On 21 July 2011 the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skill authorised officers of Companies Investigations to commence enquiries into the affairs of this company.  Following enquiries carried out by Company Investigations, a petition was presented for the company to be wound up on public interest grounds, on 7 March 2012 by the secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills.  The Official Receiver of Public Interest Unit Manchester was appointed Liquidator, by virtue of the making of the winding up order, of this company with effect from 26 July 2012.  As a result of this appointment the Official Receiver caused the company to cease trading.  On 8 August 2012 Tim Alan Askham, Robert David Adamson and Alistair Steven Wood of Mazars LLP were appointed as joint liquidators of the company.  The details of all customers, who have contacted the Official Receiver in advance of this appointment, have been passed to the liquidator who will be contacting customers in due course to advise them of his appointment. Enquiries about realisation of company assets and creditors claims should now be addressed to the liquidator and not to the Official Receiver\u2019s office.   The liquidator has set up a designated telephone number 0845 302 2536 and email address SolarEnergy.Savings@mazars.co.uk to enable creditors to contact them. "},

{"Current Status:": "The Company was incorporated on 26 July 2011. The Company traded as a printing agency between November 2011 and June 2012. The Company outsourced the actual printing to a supplier in Lithuania. The Company ceased to trade after the supplier began to fail to produce the print jobs either on time or at all. On 28 November 2012 the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, in accordance with powers conferred on him by Sections 447(3) and 453 of the Companies Act 1985, authorised officers of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to investigate the affairs of the Company. From information and documents obtained under Part XIV Companies Act 1985, it appeared to the Secretary of State that it was expedient in the public interest that the Company be wound up on the following grounds:- 1. 1.\tLack of commercial probity: The Company appeared to be one of a number of similar companies associated with Kevan Charles Eveleigh and Neill Stuart Malcolm John that have traded briefly and then been dissolved despite, in some cases, having been insolvent. One such Company, Masterclass Associates Limited, was dissolved on 26 June 2012. However, owing to information obtained in this investigation, the Secretary of State applied to the Court to restore Masterclass Associates Limited to the register and wind it up together with Ambeck Corporation Limited. Note that Mr John has approached an insolvency practitioner with a view to dissolving Ambeck Corporation Limited although the Company has unsecured liabilities of at least \u00a392,748. 2. 2.\tFailure to deliver up adequate accounting books and records / Failure to maintain and/or preserve adequate company records. 3. 3.\tBreach of provisions of the Companies Act 2006 in that the Company has not had a registered director since 02 October 2012 and the Company has not filed an annual return that was due on 23 August 2012. The Secretary of State presented his petitions to wind up both Ambeck Corporation Limited and Masterclass Associates Limited to the Court on 26 June 2013. The Court wound up both companies on 20 September 2013 and appointed the Official Receiver as liquidator."},

LP provided corporate services in the UK to German speakers, including insolvency advice.   On 21 May 2013 the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, in accordance with the powers conferred upon him by Part XIV Companies Act 1985, authorised officers of the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills to investigate the affairs of LP pursuant to Section 447 of the Companies Act 1985. From information and documents obtained under Part XIV Companies Act 1985 it appeared to the Secretary of State that it was expedient in the public interest that LP be wound up on the following grounds: -  Trading with a lack of commercial probity in facilitating the subversion and/or breach of the EU insolvency regime. Failure to maintain, preserve and/or deliver up adequate accounting records, and filing of false accounts. Lack of transparency in the management of the limited liability partnership. Failure to co-operate with the investigation.The Secretary of State presented his petition to wind up LP to the Court on 03 December 2013 and this petition was heard on 20 January 2014. The Court duly wound up LP and appointed the Official Receiver as liquidator."},

{"Current Status:": "The Company was incorporated on 29 September 2010. Upon incorporation Mark Crerar Ferguson and Gareth Paul Cooper were appointed as directors of the Company upon incorporation. Mr Cooper resigned on 23 April 2012 and Christine Ann Sutton was appointed as a director on 20 April 2012.  On 15 October 2010 the Company registered as a charity. The stated charitable objects of the Company were \u201cTo promote, for the benefit of the public, the efficiency of the police in England and Wales and to promote good citizenship and greater public participation in the prevention and solution of crime in the area. Such other purposes as are exclusively charitable according to the law of England and Wales as the trustees at their absolute discretion may from time to time decide.\u201d   The Company entered into leases with landlords of empty commercial premises and thereafter arranged for installation of Bluetooth and wi-fi transmitters. The former transmitted public interest messages. The Company paid the landlord a peppercorn rent, typically \u00a31 per annum. However, as a registered charity, the Company was entitled to mandatory rates relief of 80% and also applied for discretionary relief from the remaining 20%. The landlord was contractually bound to pay the Company a sum equal to 45% of the rates that would otherwise have been due.  The aforementioned transmitters were the property of and installed by Commercial Links Limited (\u201cCL\u201d). On 15 October 2010 The Public Safety Charitable Trust Limited (\u201cPSCT\u201d) entered into a Framework Agreement with CL for the latter to provide technical and administrative services. In return the PSCT would pay over to CL 95% of gross income.  On 27 October 2011 the Charity Commission commenced an investigation into the PSCT.  On 29 March 2012 South Cambridgeshire District Council won a court judgement against the PSCT regarding a dispute as to whether the Company was in occupation of the entirety of properties leased by the Company in the Council\u2019s district. Likewise a similar judgement was made in favour of Milton Keynes Council on 21 May 2012. The Company appealed both of these judgements. Furthermore, yet another similar case against the Company brought by Cheshire West and Chester Borough Council was heard on 26 June 2012 but, in this case, the judgement was made in favour of the Company. On this occasion, Cheshire West and Chester Borough Council appealed. All three appeals were amalgamated and heard in the High Court which, on 14 May 2013 found in favour of all three councils.  On 21 May 2013 the Charity Commission opened an enquiry into the Company\u2019s affairs.   On 29 May 2013 South Cambridgeshire District Council issued a petition to wind up the Company, stating that the Company was indebted to the Council in the sum of \u00a3238,977. This petition was heard on 08 July 2013 and the Company was duly wound up.  CL entered into voluntary liquidation on 11 July 2013.  PSCTs records disclose that, up to the date of the winding up, sales totalled \u00a39,796,456.  At a meeting of creditors on 05 September 2013 Christopher Charles Garwood of Wilkin Chapman was appointed as liquidator of the Company."},

{"Current Status:": "The Company was incorporated on 12 March 2010. The initial shareholders of the Company were Fermoya Limited (a company registered in the British Virgin Islands) and B.M.I.E Limited. These shares were transferred to Aliya Alpiyeva on 12 March 2010. On 23 January 2012 Ms Alpiyeva transferred her shareholding to Sapphire Management Holdings Limited and Maple Management Limited, both of which are companies registered in the Seychelles. On 30 May 2013 Sapphire Management Holdings Limited and Maple Management Limited transferred the shares to Bluemay Enterprises N.V, a company registered in the Dutch Antilles.  The sole recorded director of Bluemay Enterprises Limited (\u201cBluemay\u201d) since incorporation has been Scott Terence Baldwin.   On 12 December 2012 officers of the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills were authorised under Sections 447(3) and 453A of the Companies Act 1985 to require Bluemay   On 01 July 2011 Bluemay entered into an agreement with a principal, Bluemay Enterprises N.V whereby the former would hold a website, www.7red.com, on trust for the latter and any income derived from this website is the property of principal. The principal is under the control of the ultimate beneficial owner (\u201cUBO\u201d).   From information and documents obtained under Part XIV Companies Act 1985 it appeared to the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Petitioner, that it was expedient in the public interest that Bluemay be wound up pursuant to section 124A of the Insolvency Act 1986. The grounds upon which the Secretary of State sought the winding up of Bluemay were: -  The corporate structure resulted in the de jure director failing, or failing adequately, to perform his duties: - Mr Baldwin does not have an active role in the management of the Company and is therefore in breach of section 173 and/or 174 of the Companies Act 1985.Mr Baldwin is in breach of Common Law Duties in that he has failed, or failed adequately, to: -  Act honestly and/or in good faith in the best interests of the Company. Take proper care of Bluemay\u2019s assets. Prepare, approve and/or file accounts that give a true and fair view of the Company\u2019s affairs. Failure to co-operate with the Investigators: -  Mr Baldwin has not provided any meaningful information to the Investigators. The Investigators met briefly with the UBO, Ido Raviv, at his residential address in the UK on 26 February 2013. They agreed to meet again the following day but no-one was at home. On 28 February 2013 the Investigators contacted Mr Raviv by e-mail and Mr Raviv stated that he had gone to Israel for family reasons.  Thereafter, on 26 March 2013, a third party forwarded an e-mail to the Investigators from Mr Raviv dated 25 March 2013 wherein Mr Raviv stated that he was now residing in Kazakhstan and was a non resident of the UK and no longer had any business in the UK. Failure to maintain, preserve and/or deliver up accounting records: The Company\u2019s abbreviated accounts for the years-ended 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2012 show profits of \u00a3478 and \u00a3833 respectively.  However, a Company account at Wirecard Bank AG had total credits of \u20ac36,259,489 between 01 January 2011 and 18 March 2013.  Owing to the failure to maintain, preserve and/or deliver up accounting records it has not been possible to reconcile the apparent minimal activity declared in the published accounts with the volume of transactions passing through the Company\u2019s Euro account. The petition to wind up the Company was heard by the Court on 14 March 2014 and the Company was duly wound up by the Court. The Official Receiver is now liquidator of the Company.

{"Current Status:": "Dalton & Dalton Tax Consultants Ltd was incorporated on 16 January 2012.  The company offered a council tax rebanding service to householders.  On 04 April 2014 a Winding Up Order was made upon the Secretary of State\u2019s petition and the Official Receiver (Public Interest Unit, Manchester) was appointed as liquidator. The grounds for the petition were that the Company has been trading with a lack of commercial probity by making misleading and unfounded statements and selling services which provide little or commercial benefit to customers.  On 17 February 2016 Shahzad Hussain entered into a disqualification undertaking for 10 years in respect of his conduct as a director of DDTC. The disqualification commences on 09 March 2016.  On 17 February 2016 Nadeem Ashraf Sharif entered into a disqualification undertaking for 10 years in respect of his conduct as a director of DDTC. The disqualification commences on 09 March 2016. On 19 February 2016 Rizwan Zahid Zafar entered into a disqualification undertaking for 10 years in respect of his conduct as a director of DDTC. The disqualification commences on 11 March 2016.  The matters of unfit conduct not disputed were:  Between February 2012 and February 2014 Mr Hussain, Mr Sharif and Mr Zafar caused or allowed DDTC to trade in a manner lacking commercial probity in that:- DDTC provided misleading information to customers in respect of the identification of properties which were potentially in the incorrect council tax band. DDTC provided customers with incorrect information regarding the potential financial benefits. DDTC advised customers of council tax yearly savings of between \u00a3141 and \u00a3423 and council tax refunds of between \u00a32,820 and \u00a37,755. DDTC provided misleading and incorrect information on its website and in documentation provided to customers. In particular, DDTC stated that it used in-house surveyors but from February 2013 onwards DDTC did not employ surveyors.  DDTC provided misleading information to customers in respect of the probability of a successful claim. DDTC achieved rebanding to a lower band in around 65 cases in comparison with at least 3,674 cases which have been closed without a rebanding being achieved. The effect of a disqualification undertaking is that the person subject to it agrees not to, except with the permission of the court; a)\tbe a director of a company, act as receiver of a company\u2019s property or in any way, whether directly or indirectly, be concerned or take part in the promotion, formation or management of a company, unless (in each case) he/she has the leave of the court, nor b)\tact as an insolvency practitioner.\r\n\r\nThe assistance given by creditors and third parties in securing a successful outcome is gratefully acknowledged."},

{"Current Status:": "The Company was incorporated on 05 February 2009.  The initial shareholders of the Company were Fermoya Limited (a company registered in the British Virgin Islands) and B.M.I.E Limited. These shares were transferred to Highgate Holdings Limited and Merlin Holdings Limited, both companies registered in the Seychelles, on 15 December 2011.  The sole recorded director of the Company since incorporation has been Rachel Adele Forster.   On 12 December 2012 officers of the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills were authorised under Sections 447(3) and 453A of the Companies Act 1985 to require Lyncrest to produce such documents and provide such information as they might specify.  On 11 June 2012 Lyncrest entered into an agreement with an offshore principal whereby the former would hold various websites on trust for the latter and any income derived from these assets is the property of the principal. The principal is under the control of the ultimate beneficial owner (\u201cUBO\u201d).   Lyncrest\u2019s principal is Dovermill Services Limited, a company registered in Nigeria. The websites held in trust by Lyncrest appear to be adult websites.  From information and documents obtained under Part XIV Companies Act 1985 it appeared to the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Petitioner, that it was expedient in the public interest that Lyncrest be wound up pursuant to section 124A of the Insolvency Act 1986. The grounds upon which the Secretary of State sought the winding up of Lyncrest were: -  The corporate structure resulted in the de jure directors failing, or failing adequately, to perform their duties: -  Nominee director Rachel Adele Forster do / did not have an active role in the management of the Company and are/was therefore in breach of section 173 and/or 174 of the Companies Act 1985. Ms Forster is/was in breach of Common Law Duties in that she failed, or failed adequately, to: -  Act honestly and/or in good faith in the best interests of the Company. Take proper care of Lyncrest\u2019s assets. Prepare, approve and/or file accounts that give a true and fair view of the Company\u2019s affairs. Failure to co-operate with the Investigators: -  Ms Forster appeared to have little knowledge of Lyncrest and/or its affairs. The Company\u2019s UBO is Erica P Azofeifa Rodriguez, whose address is in Costa Rica. Ms Rodriguez has not responded to any approaches by the Investigators.  Failure to maintain, preserve and/or deliver up accounting records: The Company\u2019s abbreviated accounts for the years-ended 31 October 2010 and 31 October 2011 show losses of \u00a319 and \u00a3578 respectively. However, in the absence of any primary accounting records it has not been possible to verify these figures. The petition to wind up the Company was heard by the Court on 14 March 2014 and the Company was duly wound up by the Court. The Official Receiver is now liquidator of the Company.  Note that ten associated companies were also wound up in the public interest by the Court on the same day, these being: -  Bluemay Enterprises Limited. Broxon Trading Limited. Clydemill Limited. Rollmote Enterprises Limited. Sharmont Entertainment Limited. Superb Solutions Limited.  Trussel Limited. Vermillion Capital Limited. Smart Grade Consulting Limited. Hegira Services Limited."},

The companies appear to have traded in the debt recovery sector collecting debts on behalf of customers for a fee which was payable in advance.

The petitioner has been unable to distinguish between the trading of these companies and for various reasons has concluded that both companies are linked. As a consequence of these enquiries connected petitions were presented to wind both companies up on grounds of public interest detailing the following matters:  - \u2022\tObjectionable trading practices \u2013 failure to provide contracted services and abuse/threats to customers;  - \u2022\tInadequate trading records; - \u2022\tLack of transparency; and - Failure to cooperate.

{"Current Status:": "The Company was incorporated on 28 September 2004.  The initial shareholders of the Company were Simon Peter Dowson and Tanaporn Thompson. On 01 January 2006 the shares were transferred to Fermoya Limited (a company registered in the British Virgin Islands) and B.M.I.E Limited. On 15 December 2012 the shares were transferred to Sapphire Management Holdings Limited and Maple Management Limited, both of which are companies registered in the Seychelles).  The recorded directors of Superb Solutions Limited (\u201cSuperb\u201d) have been: - \r\nEMB Folds Limited (a company registered in the Seychelles) \u2013 Appointed 28 February 2013  Victoria Hall \u2013 Appointed 28 February 2013  Cathryn Dowson \u2013 Appointed 21 January 2005 Resigned 28 February 2013  Tanaporn Thompson \u2013 Appointed 28 September 2004 Resigned 21 January 2005.  On 22 April 2013 officers of the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills were authorised under Sections 447(3) and 453A of the Companies Act 1985 to require Superb to produce such documents and provide such information as they might specify. On 23 April 2007 Superb entered into an agreement with an offshore principal whereby the former would hold various websites on trust for the latter and any income derived from these assets is the property of the principal. The principal is under the control of the ultimate beneficial owner (\u201cUBO\u201d). Superb\u2019s principal is Sarentona Limited, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands. From information and documents obtained under Part XIV Companies Act 1985 it appeared to the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Petitioner, that it was expedient in the public interest that Superb be wound up pursuant to section 124A of the Insolvency Act 1986. The grounds upon which the Secretary of State sought the winding up of Superb were: - The corporate structure resulted in de jure director, Ms Hall, failing, or failing adequately, to perform her duties: -  Ms Hall did not have an active role in the management of the Company and was therefore in breach of section 173 and/or 174 of the Companies Act 1985. Ms Hall was in breach of Common Law Duties in that she failed, or failed adequately, to: -  Act honestly and/or in good faith in the best interests of the Company.Take proper care of Superb\u2019s assets. Prepare, approve and/or file accounts that give a true and fair view of the Company\u2019s affairs.  Failure to co-operate fully with the Investigators: -  Ms Hall and former director Cathryn Dowson did not provide any meaningful information to the Investigators. Likewise Ido Raviv, the UBO, provided very limited information.  Failure to maintain, preserve and/or deliver up accounting records: Filed accounts for the years-ended 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2012 show losses of \u00a3364 and \u00a33,839. However, owing to a lack of primary records, these accounts could not be verified.  The petition to wind up the Company was heard on 14 March 2014 and the Company was duly wound up by the Court.

{"Current Status:": "On 19 May 2014 Companies Investigations, a unit within the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, authorised officers to investigate the affairs of Combined Maintenance Services Limited (\u201cCMS\u201d).This investigation was linked to an investigation in to another company, One Stop Safety Maintenance UK Limited (\u201cOne Stop\u201d).  Investigators believe that CMS continued the business of One Stop.  The business model was to build up a network of electricians and gas engineers who would provide services to clients such as letting agents.  Qualified electricians/gas engineers were required to pay advance fees to the company, which were stated to guarantee them work within a designated area. On 27 October 2014, following on from these investigations, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (\u201cSecretary of State\u201d) presented petitions to the wind both companies up on grounds of public interest.   The Secretary of State also made application for the appointment of a Provisional Liquidator in the case of CMS.  At the hearing on 6 November 2014 the Secretary of State presented an application for an immediate winding up order dispensing with the need for a Provisional Liquidator.  On 6 November 2014 the court duly made a winding up order.  The Official Receiver has therefore been appointed as liquidator. The winding up petition in respect of One Stop is due to be heard on 20 November 2014.  A separate update will be provided in respect of this case. It is the Official Receiver\u2019s intention to issue a report to the creditors of CMS on or before 29 January 2015.

Lack of commercial probity in that the Company failed to provide prepaid services, failed to make good on refunds due and incurred debt whilst Value Added Tax remained unpaid.  2.

Between 21 March 2012 and 08 May 2015 Stephen William Bosanko (\u201cMr Bosanko\u201d), whilst acting as a director of G K Blonde Limited (\u201cGKB\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) acted in breach of his duty to GKB and its customers, in that: -  He appointed various parties as directors who were unable to so act including his deceased father and parties he has identified as a dog and an imaginary person.  He also appointed another individual as a director without her consent and attempted to appoint a prominent person (then also deceased) and the Companies Investigations Officer who was investigating the Company as directors.  He filed false accounts for the Company for the years-ended 31 October 2013 and 31 October 2014, which he subsequently failed to correct, that showed substantial assets for the existence of which there is no evidence. 1.Mr Bosanko has failed to ensure that the Company maintained and/or preserved any proper accounting records, or, in the alternative, he has failed to deliver up such records as were maintained. Consequently it is not possible to: -  Verify figures in the accounts to 31 October 2013 and 31 October 2014.  Definitively establish the Company\u2019s creditors.  Account for \u00a321,095 drawn in cash from the Company\u2019s bank account. Determine what happened to repayments of \u00a337,168 of a loan made by the Company. Verify the receipt of approximately \u00a360,000 said to have been paid over by a client for remittance to HMRC and the actual use to which these monies were put.   1. Mr Bosanko failed to remit to HMRC approximately \u00a346,000 paid to the Company by a client specifically for the purpose of meeting a client\u2019s VAT liabilities.2. Mr Bosanko has failed to meaningfully engage with the Official Receiver\u2019s statutory enquiries or to comply with a specific court order dated 5 October 2015 requiring him to do so."},

At the hearing on 29 June 2012 the Company will either:    1. Be placed in to compulsory liquidation (if the directors do not defend the petition).  If this happens the Official Receiver will be appointed as liquidator and will write to all of the known investors; or  2. If the directors defend the petition the hearing will be adjourned to a later date where there will be a trail and it will be up to the Court to either make the winding up order and place the Company into compulsory liquidation or dismiss the petition and remove the provisional liquidator, who would then hand the Company back to the directors.

{"Current Status:": "UK Monitoring & Response Solutions Limited (\u201cUK MARS\u201d or \u201cthe company\u201d) was incorporated on 28 October 2009 as Alarms Direct Limited. On 1 December 2010 the company changed its name to UK Monitoring & Response Solutions Limited. The company is believed to have been dormant until at least November 2010 when it is understood to have commenced trading in the provision of alarm monitoring and response services.  On 9 February 2011 the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skill authorised officers of Companies Investigations to commence enquiries into the affairs of this company. On or around 2 March 2011 the company is believed to have purchased the database of SAS Fire & Security Systems Limited (\u201cSAS\u201d) and subsequently wrote to the customers of SAS to offer, upon payment of a \u00a399 registration and administration fee, to continue monitoring and response services for which they had previously paid SAS in advance. On 25 March 2011 a winding up order was made against SAS, under court reference MDR 2483 of 2010, and the Official Receiver was appointed liquidator.The Official Receiver determined that the transfer of SAS\u2019s customer database had been undertaken following the presentation of a winding up petition against SAS and as the transfer had not been validated by the Court the acquisition by UK MARS became void upon the making of the winding-up order against SAS.   The Official Receiver notified UK MARS that the transfer was void and was informed that the company did not intend to seek to ratify the transfer as such the Official Receiver requested the return of the database and notified customers of SAS of this action.This was subsequently returned by UK MARS. Following enquiries carried out by Company Investigations, a petition was presented for the company to be wound up on public interest grounds, on 15 April 2011 by the secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills. On 25 July, the Official Receiver of Public Interest Unit Manchester was appointed as Liquidator of this company.  Based upon information currently available to him the Official Receiver does not believe that this company is in a position to continue to provide monitoring and response services for its customers.The Official Receiver is not able to provide information or advice regarding the continued provision of monitoring and response services either by the original recipient of the database or any other third parties.   If you believe that you are a creditor of this company please contact Public Interest Unit via the email address shown below quoting the name of the company. Customers should ensure that the following information is supplied; their name, address, other contact details, the date upon which they purchased the product/service; the amount paid and the period of monitoring service.  Customers should also outline the amount claimed within these proceedings and the basis upon which they are submitting any such claim.   It is the Official Receiver\u2019s intention to issue a report to creditors on or before 19 September 2011.  If you are a creditor of the company and have not received a copy of the Official Receiver\u2019s report to creditors by this date you should contact this office in order to ensure that your contact details are held."},

On 25 March 2011, the Official receiver in Manchester was appointed as Liquidator of this company.  The Official Receiver has been informed that the monitoring of existing customer alarms was transferred to another company on 2 March 2011.
